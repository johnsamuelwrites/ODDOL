# ODDOL
**Open Data Driven Online Learning**

ODDOL is an open platform that enables online learners to make use of open datasets for their projects and assignments. Users can search open datasets, analyze them, describe their results, and optionally contribute new datasets.

## Problem
Data is being released with open licenses around the world. The use of open data is the founding block for transparent data-driven decisions. However, its usage for online learning is quite limited. Most of our current online learning approaches make use of some pre-fabricated data. The students and online learners learn very little from the real social and economic potential impacts. Another, major problem is that many of these data sources are not easily findable. Therefore these datasets must be also curated.

**ODDOL** revolves around four principles for making the best use of open data.
* Search
* Analyze
* Describe
* Contribute
